## StellarKit JS Utils

Build:

    npm install
    npm run dist

### High level calls to Stellar JS SDK

Collection of Stellar APIs and useful dialogs

Includes:

-   Donate dialog with Ledger nano support.
-   Bifrost dialog for buying tokens.
-   High level JS API for Stellar

See [Stellar Client](https://github.com/StellarKit/stellar-client) for an example of using this package

The UI part uses Vuetify and VueJS, so these dialogs will only work within a vuetify v-app tag
The JS API doesn't require anything

Don't worry Vue and Vuetify are awesome and it should be simple to integrate within any website.

Check out <https://vuetifyjs.com> for more details.
